# Squirrel Stash

A Discord poll bot example built with [scurrypy](https://github.com/scurry-works/scurrypy).

## Note
This is a **reference implementation** showing how a poll bot can be built with scurrypy. 
It is meant to be read and learned from, not cloned and run as-is.

## What it demonstrates
* Slash commands
* Input parsing
* Button Interactions
* Dict management (but DB compatible)
* Addon Patterns
